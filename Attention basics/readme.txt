In this notebook, I have tried to look at how attention is implemented. Here, I am focusing on implementing attention in isolation from a larger model. 
That's because when implementing attention in a real-world model, a lot of the focus goes into piping the data and juggling the various vectors rather than the concepts of attention themselves.

Further, I will implement attention scoring as well as calculating an attention context vector.

# Speech Recognition with Neural Networks

This repo contains the final project of the Udacity NLP nanodegree program.


The purpose of this project is to build a deep neural network taht functions as a part of an end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) pipeline!

## Technogies Used

* Python
* Tensorflow
* Keras

## Project Rubric

* Model 0 : **RNN**
* Model 1 : **RNN + TimeDistributed Dense**
* Model 2 : **CNN + RNN + TimeDistributed Dense**
* Model 3 : **Deeper RNN + TimeDistributed Dense**
* Model 4 : **Bidirectional RNN + TimeDistributed Dense**

## Model Comparison 

The submission includes a detailed analysis of why different models might perform better than others.

## Final Model

The submission includes a detailed description of how the final model architecture was designed.

 ### English - French Translatoe with *RNN* ###
 
*English - French Translator* with RNN is the capstone project in my AIND.

My translator can archive 93% accuracy on word level from custom dataset that contains

* 227 unique words from 1,823,250 words in English
* 355 unique words from 1,961,295 words in French
* Implementing the translator, I use word embeding and encoding-decoding layer to improve model preformance.

* Following are libraries I use in this project: *

* [Tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow "Tensorflow") : Deep Learning library from Google
* [Keras](https://keras.io/ "Keras") : A API for different libraries to build Deep Learning model
* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/ "Numpy") : A library for mathematics operations
